### Summary
Septomeme is a play on "Magic the Gathering". We randomly generate animal images with three (3) different APIs. Also, randomly generate card text by pulling from a "Dungeons & Dragons" API. Combining all generated content to create a Septomeme card. The user can draw a new card and/or save card to their gallery.

### Technologies
 <b>Design Tools:</b>
    * Adobe XD
    * Adobe Photoshop
    * Bulma

    * Visual Code Studio

 <b>Techniques Used to Design Application </b>

    * Conditions (if else statements)
    * Document Object Model (DOM)
    * Dynamically generated HTML elements
    * Fetch API
    * Functions
    * Local storage

### Features and Functionality

    * Responsive design to accomodate any screen width (mobile, tablet, desktop, etc). These images were generated by using Bulma.
    * Client side storage allows the user to retain data.
    * Server side APIs allow the user to pull data from a server.

### Challenges

    1. Resizing images when pulled from API.
    2. Resizing of text when pulled from API.
    3. Learning to use Bulma.
    4. Pulling from local storage after refresh. The data was duplicating.
